# Environmental Data (Repositories) and Analysis

National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Training, June 2022

Training covers major environmental data repositories, methods and means of interacting with to data therein.

To run the course materials, the first step is to install Python. Though your computer likely already has Python installed, we recommend installing the [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) distribution of Python, as it includes useful utilities for manipulating your Python environment. Alternatively, you can install the commercial [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution.

Having set up Python, to then install the Python packages for the course, clone the repository and run:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`
